\title{Drug cost.}
\description{
These data are to try to understand the effect of health plan characteristics
on drug costs.  Health plans vary in size, given as member months.  Some plans
use generic drugs more than others.  All differ on copayments.  Some have
strong restrictions on which drugs can be dispensed
value of RI=0 means that all drugs are dispensed, RI=100 means that only
one per category is avaiable.  The goal is to determine the terms that are
related to cost, and in particular to understand the role of GS and RI in
determining cost.
