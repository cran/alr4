\title{Rat data}
\description{
Data collected in an experiment in which rats were injected with a dose of a
drug approximately proportional to body weight.  At the end of the experiment,
the animal's liver was weighed, and the fraction of the drug recoved in the
liver was recorded.  The experimenter expected the response to be independent
of the predictors.
